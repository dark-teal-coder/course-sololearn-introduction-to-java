## Basic Concepts

&nbsp;

### Lesson: Getting Started with Java

#### Welcome to Java!

Java is one of the most popular programming languages.

Java's slogan is "Write once, run anywhere". Java programs can run on different platforms, including mobile, desktop, and other portable systems. You can use Java to build apps, games, banking applications, web apps, and much more!

#### Coding

Humans use computer programs to communicate with machines. Without computer programs, we wouldn't have smartphones, websites, or even exploration in outer space.

</p>

Learning some coding can help you innovate and create different solutions to problems, giving you a competitive edge in this technology-driven world. 

#### Quiz 01.01

**Question**

What's a programming language?

**Answer**

A language used by humans to communicate with machines

#### Output

Most computer programs are designed to produce outputs. Here are some examples:

 - "You've got a new message" notifications
 - "Game Over" displayed on the screen when playing video games
 - Your account balance when checking your online banking app.

The simplest output consists of displaying a message on the screen.

#### Quiz 01.02

**Question**

Notifications and text displayed on a screen are examples of outputs from computer programs

**Answer**

True

#### Output

Coders use outputs all the time to check that the computer is following the given instructions and fix problems with code.

The following line of code displays Java's slogan on the screen as an output:

```java
System.out.println("Write once, run anywhere!");
```

#### Quiz 01.03

**Question**

Drag and drop to write a line of code that outputs "New message".

**Answer**

"New message"

#### The Code Playground

Ready to write, run and test real code?

Open the Code Playground below. Then hit "run" to see the output on the screen.

```java
public class Program
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Welcome to the Code Playground");
	}
}
```

You'll see other lines of code when you open the Code Playground. They are needed for the code to run without errors. You will learn everything about these lines in the upcoming lessons.

#### Quiz 01.04

**Question**

Drag and drop to complete a line of code that outputs "Game Over".

**Answer**

`println`

#### Quiz 01.05

**Question**

The `println` instruction needs to be followed by parentheses.

Drag and drop to create a line of code that runs without errors.

**Answer**

`(` and `)`

#### Quiz 01.06

**Question**

Drag and drop to create a line of code that runs without errors.

**Answer**

`out` and `println`

#### Lesson Takeaways

Awesome! You completed your first lesson ðŸš€. Remember the following important points:

- You can write code that generates outputs with the `System.out.println()` statement
- The `println` instruction needs to be followed by parentheses

What's next?

In the next lesson, you will create code with multiple lines and different types of data.

&nbsp;

### Lesson: Multiple Statements

#### More Complex Programs

Real computer programs can include thousands of lines of code.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll start building more complex programs.

#### Statement

A line of code is called a statement. A statement performs a specific task.

The output command is an example of a statement.

```java
System.out.println("Write once, run anywhere!");
```

> :warning: Each statement needs to end with a semicolon `;`.
